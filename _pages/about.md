I am a PhD student in Finance at the Shidler College of Business, [University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/). My research interests span financial intermediation, corporate finance, real estate, and environmental economics. My past affiliations include [University of Hawaiʻi Economic Research Organization](https://uhero.hawaii.edu/) and the [Institute for Sustainability and Resilience at Mānoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/isr/).

      Sea Level Rise Impacts on Residential Real Estate Value in Hawaiʻi
      <em style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 0.75rem; color: #555;"> (Forthcoming, <i>Climatic Change</i>)</em>
    </h3>
    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 0.65rem;">
      We show that Hawaiʻi's housing market is already responding to the risks of sea level rise (SLR). Drawing on two decades of repeat sales data, we find that homes projected to be exposed to 3 ft of SLR appreciate about 0.8% less per year than comparable unexposed homes, with larger discounts on Oʻahu and Hawaiʻi Island. Local buyers drive much of this effect, applying nearly double the penalty of non-local buyers, underscoring how beliefs and local knowledge shape climate risk pricing. Adaptive measures such as seawalls do not offset the climate penalty. The discount is tied specifically to direct inundation risk rather than neighborhood-level loss of function, suggesting markets focus on property-level habitability. A back-of-the-envelope calculation implies that buyers expect meaningful SLR impacts within the next 50 years, highlighting how long-term climate risks are being priced into coastal real estate today.
